# Blackjack, the Jack Black of card games

## Rules
In order to recreate the game, we should first learn what the rules are. After playing the game online a few times and using the ancient divine art of all programmers before me (Googling stuff), I have written down all the rules, everything you need, and how you should play the game in the list under this text. [This website](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) helped me understand the rules. </br>

### Necessities
* We need a standard 52-card pack:
  * I will try to make an array that will be used as the deck (const DeckOfCards = ["One", "1"], ["King", "10"],...)
### Objective of the game
* The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
### Value of cards
* Every card is its own value, (Hearts of two = 2, Spade of Nine = 9)
* Each individual player chooses themselves if the Ace card is worth 1 or 11,  in all the games I've played the card had a value of 11, so that's what I'm gonna do
  * I think adding an option where the player can decide for themselves what the value of the ace should be would be extremely fun.
  * Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points
### Betting Mechanic
* I won't be implementing this for now, however, if i have some time left I'd definetly like to do this
  * I'm thinking I should just create a let variable with the amount of chips in it, and then let the player choose between different buttons that will be used as chips to raise the amount they'd like to gamble.
### The Deal
* Once the bet has been placed (Which won't be relevant in this game for now), the dealer gives one card face up to the player and then one card face up to themselves. The player then gets a second face-up card, but the dealer gets his card face down.
* If the player gets a natural 21 (a card with a value of 10 and an ace), then they immediately win. If both the player and the dealer get a natural 21, then it's a tie.
  * In case of a tie when gambling is involved, the player gets their own chips back.
* If the player wins, he gets his own chips and those of the dealer.
* If the dealer wins, he gets his own chips and those of the player.
### The Play
* The player goes first, and they'll have to decide weather they want to "stand" or "hit"
  * ~~Stand = A Stand is an entity psychically generated by its owner, referred to as a Stand User (スタンド使い, Sutando Tsukai). It generally presents itself as a figure hovering over or near the user and possesses abilities beyond that of an ordinary human, which, depending on the Stand User, can be wielded for good or evil.~~
  * Stand = To not ask for another card, the higher the value of your current cards is, the more likely you are to press on this button
  * Hit = Ask the dealer for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21 or get 21 exactly.
    * The higher your current value of cards is, the less likely you are to click this button.
### The Dealers Play
* This one is extremely important, because the dealer has some rules he must follow no matter what. This means it is very easy to program. 
* When the dealer has served every player (just a single player in this case), the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand.
  * The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.

#### There's a ton of gambling related rules, that I will try to implement and then write out as well if I have the time.

## Rules are just boneless programming scripts 
With all the rules written down and a couple of L's taken by me from the Blackjack games I've found online, I am a **HUUUUGE** step closer to creating my very own Blackjack game:
My current objectives are (I did not write the list in chronological order):
* Creating a HTML, CSS, and JS page
* Creating an array of objects in JS that will serve as the deck of cards
* Write out a function of the way I see the dealer hitting once the player presses the "stand" button cards (if his current value of cards is 16 or less, let him hit cards until he gets a value higher than 21)
* Create let variables for the current hand that the player has, and one of the dealer
* Write out a card hitting function, whenever a specific card has been hit, it needs to be removed from the deck. And once the game is done, all cards should be added back to the deck.
  * The function needs to be called out when:
    * The player presser the hit button
    * At the very start, when both the player and the dealer get two cards each.
    * The computer hits a card
* Creating a function that gives out two cards respectively to the player and the dealer, with one card of the dealer being face down
  * I might have to add a "Backside" value and a "Frontside" value to the card objects. 
    * Or this Won't be needed, and I'll just add one jpeg of the back of a card that will be used by every second card of the dealer.

#### That's all I got for now, planning is one thing but actually coding is another one entirely.

### Fun features
* The backside of all cards will be a Yu-Gi-Oh card
